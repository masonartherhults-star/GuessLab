#Algorithm for guesser game
...
main():
  make a 20-length char array userName
  make an integer called guess initialize -999
  make an integer called correct will be randomly generated
  make an integer called turns, initialize to 0
  make an integer (boolean) called keepGoing start true (-1)

  seed random number generator
  generate a random number between 1 and 100 put in correct
  ask user name put in userName
  greet user with name

  while keepGoing is true:
    increment turns
    ask user for a number put it in guess
    if guess < correct:
      tell them "Too low"
    else if guess > correct:
      tell them "Too high"
    else:
      tell them "You win!"
      set keepGoing to false

  evaluate the perfomance
  if turns < 7:
    say "That's great"
  else if turns > 7:
     say "You could do better"
  else:
     say "Good job"
